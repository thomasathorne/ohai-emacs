(package-require 'clojure-mode)

;; We'll be using Monroe, a simple nREPL client. To use it, you'll need
;; to start an nREPL somewhere (running `lein repl' in your project should
;; do the trick) and run `M-x monroe' to connect to it and open a REPL
;; buffer.
(package-require 'monroe)

;; We'll also be using clj-refactor for refactoring support. The features
;; which require CIDER won't work with Monroe.
(package-require 'clj-refactor)

;; We might need Paredit too if that's how you like it.
(package-require 'paredit)
